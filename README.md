# Saviynt Artifacts Collection

This collection aims to improve the overall efficiency of Saviynt implementation, leading to faster Time to Value (TTV). It contains various artifacts commonly used in projects and major initiatives across Saviynt product lines. These artifacts have been tested in multiple projects over the past few years.

## Collection Highlights

* **Analytics:** Collection of few performance related Analytics.

* **Kick Off Decks:** Three presentation templates for project kickoffs - one for executives, one for Privileged Access Management (PAM), and a generic template for any project/initiative.
* **Application Onboarding Sheets:** Effective templates to gather information from application owners, facilitating efficient data collection and management. These multi-project tested templates help document requirements and information crucial for application/service rollout. They are general-purpose and can be used for any integration. The collection includes a JML template for HR/Source of Truth integrations and a specific template for collecting PAM information from machines and service accounts.
* **Project Plans:** Two project execution templates - one for PAM implementation and another for combined IGA+PAM implementation. These templates cover all tasks from kickoff to hypercare.
* **Connections:** A collection of commonly used connectors. We recommend referring to the latest Saviynt documentation for connector configuration details. These samples are for reference purposes only and may be used by many customers. Please review them carefully before use.
* **Email Templates:** Ten email templates covering all steps of the Access Request addition and removal process.
* **SAV Roles:** Two sample SAV Roles for reference. Consider reviewing if these roles are truly necessary, as Saviynt provides out-of-the-box roles sufficient for most use cases and personas.
* **Workflows:** Two highly used workflows are included. The "Risk-Based Workflow" is dynamic, increasing approval levels based on requested access criticality. Some customers use this as their primary access request workflow.
* **Other Transport Files:** This section provides related objects required for other artifacts to function properly. These include User Groups used in workflows for exceptions (e.g., entitlements without owners with the required risk level rank).
* **UAT and Demo:** A demo script for showcasing the implementation and documenting test results.
* **Checklist before Go-Live:** A collection of all major checklists to ensure completion of all activities before going live, including support transition and other vital tasks.
* **Post Implementation Artifacts:** These artifacts can be used to update user, account, entitlement, and other object properties.
